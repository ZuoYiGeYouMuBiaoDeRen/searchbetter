I&#39;m Lila Fisher, an Edx fellow helping to put together these courses. As you know, our courses are entirely online. So before we start learning about the subjects that brought you here, let&#39;s learn about the tools that you will use to navigate through the course material. Let&#39;s start with what is on your screen right now. You are watching a video of me talking. You have several tools associated with these videos. Some of them are standard video buttons, like the play Pause Button on the bottom left. Like most video players, you can see how far you are into this particular video segment and how long the entire video segment is. Something that you might not be used to is the speed option. While you are going through the videos, you can speed up or slow down the video player with these buttons. Go ahead and try that now. Make me talk faster and slower. If you ever get frustrated by the pace of speech, you can adjust it this way. Another great feature is the transcript on the side. This will follow along with everything that I am saying as I am saying it, so you can read along if you like. You can also click on any of the words, and you will notice that the video jumps to that word. The video slider at the bottom of the video will let you navigate through the video quickly. If you ever find the transcript distracting, you can toggle the captioning button in order to make it go away or reappear. Now that you know about the video player, I want to point out the sequence navigator. Right now you&#39;re in a lecture sequence, which interweaves many videos and practice exercises. You can see how far you are in a particular sequence by observing which tab you&#39;re on. You can navigate directly to any video or exercise by clicking on the appropriate tab. You can also progress to the next element by pressing the Arrow button, or by clicking on the next tab. Try that now. The tutorial will continue in the next video.', 'chapter_mid': 'HarvardX/EMC2x/chapter/11b2757a6d524b4eb05fac7d80001848'}\n",

This is a course about the manifold connections of physics to the rest of the world in the 20th century and early 21st century with Albert Einstein as our guide. It\\'s not a biography of Einstein, though some very good biographies do exist and I\\'ll refer you to them. Instead, it\\'s about the connections that exist between physics and the rest of the world. How widespread is the mark of Einstein? Well, we think we know Herman Hupfeld\\'s 1931 \"As Time Goes By,\" that most famous song of the most famous scene of the most famous film, Casablanca. DOOLEY WILSON \"SAM\" (SINGING): You must remember this. A kiss is just a kiss. A sigh is just a sigh. The fundamental things apply as time goes by. PETER GALISON: The reason that I want to show you this up front is that there\\'s something missing. In Casablanca, Dooley Wilson-- Sam-- did not sing the first of Herman Hupfeld\\'s verses. Here is Binnie Hale singing \"As Time Goes By\" in 1932 with the first verse. BINNIE HALE (SINGING): This day and age we\\'re living in gives cause for apprehension. With speed and new invention and things like third dimension. Yet we get a trifle weary with Mr. Einstein\\'s theory, so we must get down to earth at times. Relax, relieve the tension. You must remember this. A kiss is just a kiss-- PETER GALISON: But even Hale, and others like Rudy Vallee, changed the lyrics ever so slightly when they sung that first verse. The fourth dimension was simply too unfamiliar, and they morphed it into the third dimension. Why it was so unfamiliar, why it was so shocking to people, is one of the great subjects of the first big part of this course. We\\'ll be looking, over the extent of this online course, at three large scale components of the relationship of Einstein\\'s physics to the rest of the world. First, there are the relativities, special theory and the general theory. We\\'ll look at how they linked to technologies of the day, to the battles over the ether. But also at the relationship of art and science and how the art world of everything from painting and sculpture to the development of architecture all drew on ideas of space and time. We\\'ll look at the relationship of politics and science, both coming in to Einstein\\'s life and emerging from his interventions in the world. We\\'ll look at the relationship of philosophy and science. Philosophy coming into the relativity theories and philosophy coming out of the relativities. Second, we\\'ll look at nuclear weapons. Einstein was involved to a quite limited extent in the development of nuclear weapons, but in two small but very important ways. First, his ideas of relativity, which led him to E equals MC squared, was used in the discovery and understanding of nuclear fission. And second, Einstein helped warn President Roosevelt that nuclear weapons might be in the offing and that the Nazis might be on the track towards them. We\\'ll look at the Nazi work on the atomic bomb. We\\'ll look at the American project. We\\'ll understand how radically the intervention of nuclear weapons in the world of physics changed the contract between science and society. Third, we\\'ll look at quantum mechanics. Einstein often remarked that he spent much more time thinking about quantum theory than he did about both relativity theories combined. We\\'ll be interested in the theory of quantum mechanics, the philosophy of quantum mechanics, how it related to relativity theory, the technology of application of quantum mechanics. The development and understanding, for instance, of the transistor. And now its innermost strangeness. The part of quantum theory that Einstein most objected, namely the entanglement of particles even when they were very distantly separated. That entanglement has itself become the basis for a radical new form of machine. In each of these three sections of the course-- the relativities, nuclear weapons, quantum physics-- we come back to Einstein and use them as a crossing point for culture, science, and the material world. In each instance, we\\'ll start with Einstein and come up toward the present and even the future. What\\'s required for this course is no particular knowledge in physics or mathematics. We will use a bit of algebra. What I really need is for you not to be totally panicked by a plus b over 2. But everyone should find, in different ways, familiarity with different parts of the course. Some parts will be easier than others. There\\'s going to be people who are more comfortable with the art or philosophy or politics or physics than others. But altogether, we\\'ll see how these pieces of the world converged or crossed at the Einsteinian interchange. There\\'ll be an interactive component of the course in each of the lessons to follow. Sometimes, they\\'ll be multiple choice questions, especially when it\\'s introducing new ideas of physics. Sometimes they\\'ll be interpretive questions addressed through very short essays-- like a paragraph. And sometimes, they\\'ll be collective activities. The construction of debates for instance, or a Wiki page, or the assembly of an exhibit out of different images that people gather and put together to form a kind of virtual museum. This course is itself a kind of grand experiment to explore in the most interdisciplinary way possible how things and thoughts connected. It\\'s a way of probing that strange and fascinating intersection of metaphysics and machines that make up some of the most riveting parts of our world today.

One of the great ideas of the 19th century is something that has disappeared without a trace, the idea of an ether. When James Clerk Maxwell began to explore electricity and magnetism, he discovered that there could be waves, and of course, it seemed obvious to him that a wave had to be a wave in something. You could have a wave in water or a wave on your jump rope. You could have a shock wave like the pressure of my voice as it moves through the air. You could kick a desk and feel the shockwave go through that. You could have waves of spinning electrons. You have all sorts of waves, but they're always waves in something. And so it seemed obvious to Maxwell and everybody else that there must be a substance where these electric waves were disturbances in. And so they began to explore what might the properties of that all-pervasive substance be. If light was just a wave, then it must be a disturbance in this medium. Couldn't just beyond the Earth because light from stars came from far beyond the air. So what were its properties? That became a big issue. One of the great American physicists, in fact, the first to win a Nobel Prize was Albert Michelson. And he with his colleague, Morley, began to explore what our motion in this all-pervasive ether might be. And so he thought, I'll figure out a way of figuring out whether we're moving fast in this direction or slow in that direction, or is the ether moving at different sides when we're at different parts of the orbit around the sun. What's going on? And he built the most fantastically accurate device to explore whether we're moving in the ether by sending a light wave in two different directions reflecting it off mirrors and then letting the light waves interfere when they got back. It was an extraordinarily sensitive device, and he got no result. He thought, this is the greatest failure of my life. I mean, it was a failure that led to the first Nobel Prize in the United States, but he thought it was a great failure. He couldn't find motion through the ether. Well, one of the great, indeed, one of the first truly towering figures in theoretical physics was the Dutchman, Hendrik Lorentz, and he explained Michelson's failure to detect movement in the ether by supposing, just supposing that every object as it moved through the ether contracted just a little bit by a factor of 1 over the square root of 1 minus v squared over c squared, where v is just the fraction of the speed of light, so v over c is 1/2, if you're going half the speed of light. So you take this factor, 1 over the square root of 1 minus v squared over c squared and you imagine that for some reason having to do with the way the constituent particles of a ruler or a chair or a house, if you're moving through the ether, you squish just a little bit and that keeps it from being visible that you're moving through the ether. You might have thought it would take longer to go into the ether wind than perpendicular to it, but no, everything squishes out just enough to compensate for it and no detection of motion through the ether could be made. And so Michelson was explained. The great mathematician, Henri Poincare, agreed.  Now, Poincare was in addition to being one of France's great mathematicians-- the country where you can get your name inscribed in stone towering over the city of Paris by being a great mathematician. It's a country that values its mathematicians. He was a physicist and contributed importantly to physics. He was a philosopher whose books continue to be read even today and were smash hits at the time they were written. He was in charge of the Academy of Letters as well as the Academy of Sciences. He was an extraordinary polymath whose skills ranged from matters of state to the details of some of the most erudite and complicated parts of science. But he began his scientific work as a student at the Ecole Polytechnique, then back in the late 19th century and still now, a school the prepared people jointly for roles in the state, in the military, in industry, and in science. He recorded everything with an eye towards mapping. And this was Poincare's great insight into so many branches, mathematics and physics. He looked for ways to visualize things, to map them, to get control of them through our intuitions about the visual world. He wrote to his mother, for example, and drew a picture of the path he was taking in his exploration looking for coal up in Scandinavia. When he got sick, he graphed the shape of the side of his cheek as a function of time. When he went down as a young apprentice to mine inspection to try to figure out how to make the coal mines safer and to figure out what happened should something go wrong, he did an extraordinary investigation of one devastating accident, which killed many, many miners. And he tracked by graphing the flow of air through the whole mine, he tracked back where the source of the explosion must have been to a single pickaxe hit on a Davy lamp, a lamp whose small perforations allowed light to come out but kept dangerous methane gas from combusting. He figured out ways beyond these practical matters of coal mining to graph planetary orbits. In fact, we call the Poincare map an imaginary plane where we see a puncture each time a planet goes through and then we can look at the pattern of these puncture lines. Are they converging? Are they diverging? What are they doing? And so you take this incredibly complicated, three-dimensional problem and reduce it just to a sequence on a plane, a map. And in fact, this Poincare map led him after a great deal of difficulty to discover what becomes chaos theory, nonlinear dynamics, one of the tremendous developments of 20th century science. \", 'chapter_mid': 'HarvardX/EMC2x/chapter/26cde64e24474f8aaf25332c0b6d25f1'}\n",

One of the longstanding issues for the French had been that they wanted to rationalize the system of measures. Everybody hated, in France, this idea that a measure of length should be the British king's foot and they thought it would be much more rational, in the French Revolution, they said, to have decimal system of measure, to have kilograms and meters that were philosophically grounded in the reasonable and the rational. And so they began to try to work on that. Unfortunately, Napoleon sold out a lot of those results, but there was an attempt to try to get this straight. And in the 100th anniversary of the events of the French Revolution, there was an attempt, 1889, to get the world to come around to this system of kilograms and meters. And so there was a moment where there was a ceremonial burying of k, the perfect kilogram and m, the perfect meter, and that these would become the world's standards, those individual objects. So what you see here is the closet, the multiple-protected closet where, k the kilograms, sits in a evacuated bell jar with its witnesses, the temoins all around it, who would bear witness with their bodies should something untoward happen to k. And m, the meter stick, was in that high tube that's there. There was a great conflict over whether they could get the right keys for this because the foreign delegates would only treat this space as international territory. They wouldn't speak to the interior minister who had the key, so they had to get the foreign minister to do this. It was a big battle but, finally, they buried these and suddenly they ascended to become the perfect k and the perfect m. Flushed with success at this idea of getting the world to accept those French revolutionary quantities of the kilogram and the meter, the French tried to introduce a notion of centralized and standardized time. One of the first attempts to standardize time was actually extremely physical. You had a center, a pumping station, [SPEAKING FRENCH] in Northeastern Paris and when a signal came to it, it would release a pulse of air, and those pulses would race under the city of Paris and reset clocks at each of the mayoral headquarters of the [SPEAKING FRENCH]. And that was public displays of standardized astronomically authorized time became matters a great veneration. Now not everybody liked this, but you can see in this picture the buying of time at a Paris store that sold pneumatic clocks where if you were rich enough, you could get an attachment through a little tube to the pulsed air that would reset time and give you personal access to this standard astronomically authorized time. But one of the people who detested this idea was a poet, literary figure, Georges de Porto-Riche. Georges de Porto-Riche said that he was absolutely devastated by the sound of this pulsed air racing through the streets. In August of 1880, he brought suit against the pneumatic time system. This [SPEAKING FRENCH], these pulsing of air, had driven away, as he put it, all his poetical and dramatic creativity. It's one of those moments that a historian loves because you have there the confrontation in very concrete terms of somebody whose older conception of creativity and poetry was meeting head on in a collision with this attempt to make modern technology, in this case, audible. Now, sending pulses of compressed air might work under a relatively small and self-contained area like Central Paris, but it wasn't good enough to coordinate clocks that were distant from one another. So people began to think about using telegraphs, and they would send a pulse, say, at noon and people would set the clock to noon when they got that pulse. Now, a new method that was even better was using a seismograph-like machine, a turning cylinder that would record the local time pulses from just set by a local clock and the clock of a distant time. So you could see quite precisely how the distant time related to your own clock. Let's take a look at that from our collection here at the collection of historical scientific instruments. This is the collection of historical scientific instruments at Harvard. It's a grouping of about 20,000 scientific instruments that have been gathered here for scientific research and teaching since the 17th century. There's a great collection that we have of clocks and timekeeping devices from across the centuries and encountering the physical objects themselves can teach us things that purely a theoretical representation can't. So this seismograph-looking machine was actually used to record time impulses sent from clocks like the ones we've been looking at. It was called the American method and it replaced a very crude system where a telegraph operator would send a signal or receive a signal or maybe the telegraph signal would come in and it would move a tiny mirror and the flash of light would be recorded by a telegraph operator. So what this did was to mark from a local clock-- this would turn, there would be paper on here-- and the local clock would say, pulse every second to make a little inscription. And then when the signal came say, from across the ocean or wherever it was being sent, it would make a pulse also and then you could see exactly where the distant pulse was measured compared to the local one-second marks. And so you could graphically extract from this very, very precisely to within a couple of thousandths of a second where that signal was in time. So you could measure the difference of time of say noon and Greenwich, England from noon wherever you were on the coast of United States. \", 'chapter_mid': 'HarvardX/EMC2x/chapter/26cde64e24474f8aaf25332c0b6d25f1'}\n",

Because the big question was, if you ran a train line over a long longitudinal distance, say from Boston to Chicago, or from Chicago to LA, or from one side of Russia to the other side of Russia, what time did you use? Did you use the time of the town where the station was? After all, you had a local jeweler who typically would be fixing noon by looking at the noon day sun and setting clocks in his store that other people would then check their watches and clocks against. Or do you use the time where the train arrives or the train starts? So the first time zones were actually a couple of feet wide and thousands of miles long. The train tracks themselves became a kind of time zone set by the city where the train began its voyage. So if it began in New York, you used New York time. If it began in LA, you used LA time. If it began in Moscow, you used Moscow time. In this way people began to have the train time, and then you would have the local time of the town that it was going through. So you have village time, or town time, or city time, and train time. But what if you had two train tracks crossing in a town? Then you had, say, a New York time, a Chicago time, and the local time, and you could see how this rapidly leads to insanity. The great standardization of American time was introduced by the railroads. And the railroad magnates who made this decision set and divided the country into zones, orange slice-like zones, in November of 1883. They actually voted on this, the trains voted on this, by the number of miles of track you had. So if you were Leland Stanford, for example, and you owned thousands of miles of tracks, you got thousands of votes. So a couple of the leading magnates of the train industry divided up the country into these zones. As soon as you had these zones, the towns began to conform to the time zones that were set by the trains. And in fact, Harvard University began selling time. They had clocks that were attached to their very sophisticated observatory. And when the clocks would measure a certain time, they would send pulses down telegraph lines that went to the train tracks and then out across New England. But the issue of competition went deep. Not just, say, Harvard time versus Yale time-- both of them were trying to control as much of New England time as they could-- but between Paris and London. In London, Greenwich Observatory, which is just outside the main part of the city, was competing with the Paris Observatory, which you can see from the [FRENCH]. And they were ferociously battling about who would set the zero of time. Where is the zero of longitude from which all the other times will be determined? The French said, we have a long philosophical tradition. We\\'re the people that brought the kilogram and the kilometer. Why would you do anything that wasn\\'t philosophically grounded? And the British said, well, we sell maps to the most clients in the world. Most of the world\\'s shipping are our clients, and they use our Admiralty maps. And the French said, clients? We\\'re speaking of the division of science, and you speak to us of clients? Well, the French suspected the British of having fixed the election by paying off some of the small countries into a coalition of the willing, which in fact, they were right-- the British had. The Americans and the British had conspired to fix this election rather clearly, and they won. They set the zero of longitude, and therefore the zero of time, at Greenwich Observatory. Well, this centralization of world time, the organization into zones based on the time of Greenwich, was a kind of symbol and universal aspiration of what time could mean. But time meant other things to other people. The anarchist Prince Kropotkin in 1898-99 said, \"after a week\\'s stay with the watchmakers in Switzerland, my views were settled. I was an anarchist.\" Well, anarchism was on the rise throughout much of Europe at this time. And many anarchists from France and Italy had taken refuge in London, including a fellow named Martial Bourdin, who began to plot an attack. It was thought to be an assault on the Greenwich Observatory. He built a bomb and was carrying it up the hill towards the observatory when he had what\\'s called these days a work accident, and unfortunately for him, blew himself up below the Tower of Time. This incident, when it occurred, led the people who were running the time room at the observatory to say one to the other, Mr. Hollis, spot the time-- 4:51. Well, what for Bourdin was the end of his life was for them the triumph of the imposition of time back on the threat to their own existence. This incident struck Joseph Conrad as enormously important. And in his most popular book, The Secret Agent, he used this incident of Bourdin to create a fictionalized version of this assault on the center of time on this universal governing, controlling, scientific aspiration to map the world\\'s times. And just to add yet a third chapter to that story, the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, when he was attacking scientists around the country, modeled himself on one of the figures from The Secret Agent, which was a fictionalized version of Bourdin\\'s attack on Greenwich.  So you have a back and forth between the hardest edge of reality, of explosions, and attacks, and assaults, and anarchism, and terrorism, and the practical aspects of navigation, and mapping, and control of the world, with fiction. And back and forth it went, because time was always more than just a technique. Time was part of a political symbolism. Time was part of a literary symbolism. Time was part of a technological goal that was shared by scientists around the world. ', 'chapter_mid': 'HarvardX/EMC2x/chapter/26cde64e24474f8aaf25332c0b6d25f1'}\n",

Back from revolutionary times you can even see clocks that were divided into 10 parts instead of 12 to make a kind of harmony with the kilogram and the kilometer that time itself should be decimal, not this crazy system of 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day and arbitrary numbers of days in a month and so on. So the idea of standardizing time to something decimal seemed like something the French wanted. And one of Poincare's first state assignments was to explore whether there was a more rational way of dividing up the circle, the clock, than simply the 12 parts in which it's been divided or the 360 degrees of a standard circle. So Poincare began to explore that, and, in fact, came to the conclusion that you should make the decision purely as to what was the most convenient in converting to other kinds of units-- what would be the least amount of multiplication? Because deep in Poincare's system of belief, his philosophical approach to everything scientific, was that we had a lot of freedom to choose conventions about how we would proceed, as long as we accounted for the things that were observed. But within that stricture of accounting for what we observed, we have many choices. There's a kind of arbitrariness to our conventional way of doing science. And yet, Poincare believed that choosing the simplest such system was an objective matter-- that is to say, everyone would agree that multiplying by one-digit numbers was simpler than multiplying by two-digit numbers. Well, Poincare became involved in more and more of these efforts to standardize time, to think about science in a state context. One of his tasks was working at the Bureau of Longitude. It's very hard to determine longitude, as it turns out. Latitude is easy-- if you're in the northern hemisphere you look up, you see where the North Star is, if it's right above you you're the North Pole, if it's halfway down you're sort of in temperate climes, if it's right at the equator you're at your at the equator of the Earth. And so this gives us a clear way of determining how distant you are from true north. Well, the problem with longitude is that you can't do that because the world is spinning. Well, it's good the world is spinning because we know the problems if it didn't spin, but it because it spins you can't just take a map and look at what star is above you and determine how far east or west you are, say, of Greenwich, because the stars keep turning and they look like they keep turning around the North Star. So you have to make a simultaneous measurement. You have to say, well, this star is above Greenwich but this star is above me, and so I can look on my map and determine how far I am to the east or the west of Greenwich. Well, what do you do when you're on a boat? How do you determine, for instance, or your somewhere else, not in Greenwich, and you want to know how far east or west you are? You need to know what time it is in Greenwich. Well, you could bring a watch with you or a clock with you that's set to Greenwich time, but it turns out clocks really hate to take trips. They hate it-- they hate the pitch and roll of ships at sea, they hate the changes of moisture, they hate the changes of temperature-- they just hate going to sea. So people would take hundreds of these clocks. Darwin had hundreds of these clocks when he went on his big expedition and he tried to average them, but sometimes the clocks would hate traveling in the same way, and if they all slow down it doesn't matter that you have a hundred of them. So people began to try to measure these distances, and the best way of doing it was sending an electrical signal by telegraph. And Poincare's Bureau of Longitude and the other Bureaus of Longitude in the United States and Britain, all the imperial powers were trying to map the world, to symbolically and practically have control over the world map. And so there was a kind of race that went on-- the astronomers, the military affiliation would go to different places and Poincare would be communicating with them, and there they'd be. You shouldn't picture beautiful white lab coats at the top of a romantic mountain. You have this hut that see here, for example, with a guy in his pith helmet who's getting a telegraphic signal and looking out his scope to see what star is right above. So you have this race to map the world up in the Andes and in Quito people did an expedition to try to map the shape of the world. There were maps to try to map Africa and the great seizure of lands that was taking place by the imperial powers. It was a huge structure that was being built-- cables being laid all over the world, under the oceans and over the mountains. It was a world-covering machine, a kind of internet of [INAUDIBLE]. They went down the coast of Africa to Senegal, where the French were fighting an anti-insurrectionary war that went on for many years. And Poincare was in touch with them, constantly trying to refine and modify these signals of time to try to determine longitude to map the world. All of these were very practical engineering problems that Poincare was involved with in every way. \", 'chapter_mid': 'HarvardX/EMC2x/chapter/26cde64e24474f8aaf25332c0b6d25f1'}\n",

In fact, he was one of the founders of a new journal that came out in the late 19th century that was designed to create a philosophy around science where he and other [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] at the time would think about the fundamental questions of philosophy through the lens of what was being understood in science. So they'd ask, for instance, what did time mean if you didn't have a measure? You were always speaking of something in motion. If you said, for instance, that a pendulum swung at a certain rate, did that set the standard of time and then you use that to measure the turning of the Earth? Would you use the turning of the Earth and then talk about the motion of the pendulum relative to that? You always had to make choices, and Poincare was deeply committed to that idea. In January of 1898, he wrote an article on the philosophy of simultaneity. What do we mean by this idea? What do we mean by measuring time? He said if two longitude finding telegraphers want to coordinate clocks, what do they do? Well, one sends a signal to the other taking into account the time of signaling. Time of signaling takes a second from one place to another. It'd have to be a pretty far place, but it takes a second. Then if you send it at 12:00, then you set it on receipt at 12:00 plus one second. Now, this could be thought of as a kind of brain-in-a-vat imaginary thought experiment, but it wasn't. Poincare was reporting on what he saw all the time by his time-signaling telegraphers who were finding longitude. That's what they did it. The Paris Observatory would send a signal out, bounce it off Recife, say, and get it back, figure out how long that took, divide by 2, and then from that, know how long it took to get from Paris to Recife in Brazil. So if you set the clock 12:00-- if the clock's at 12:00 in Paris, then Recife would set it to 12:00 plus half that round-trip time. This was important because what had been just an ordinary piece of everyday map-making, longitude-finding became Poincare's definition of what simultaneity really was. You couldn't refer to the sensorium of God or metaphysics or the equitable flow of time. He had a procedure, and it was the procedure that determined what was simultaneous. So now, we could ask-- this idea of the exchange of electrical signals being used to set simultaneity of two distant clocks, is it truly an idea of philosophy or is it truly an idea of engineering? Well, in 1898, it was both. It was at the intersection of two different paths. It had a role to play in the development of this new philosophy of science, and it had a role to play in the establishment of longitude for all of the great powers-- for Britain, for the United States, and for France. But Poincare believed that it had nothing to offer physics itself. He thought the corrections because of this-- taking into account signaling time-- would never be competitive with the much larger errors that were introduced in synchronizing clocks-- say by the error introduced by the telegraph operator in his reaction time to hearing a beep and hitting the key. But that changed. On December 10th, 1900, Poincare was asked to speak at a conference in honor of Lorentz. And when he did, he realized that an idea of Lorentz's could be very important. Lorentz, you remember, said that objects had to contract a little as they moved into the ether. Poincare thought that was fine. But in addition, Lorentz said maybe we need to change this variable t for time that occurs in our equation. And if we modify it just a little bit, then it'll make the equations look mostly the same in different moving frames of reference. Well, Poincare hated that idea. He thought it was ad hoc, it was arbitrary, had no reason to do it. But then as he was preparing this talk for the 10th of December in 1900, he realized that there might be something to what Lorentz was saying-- that in fact, if you pictured two of Poincare's telegrapher longitude finders as they moved through the ether, the first one of them, say, sending a light signal to the second, as they move through the ether, that light would have to push against the apparent wind of the ether as you moved through it. Well, Poincare calculated what that affect should be and realized that he got just the quantity that Lorentz had introduced as a purely mathematical artifact. So now, Poincare said, well, maybe what I have done for defining time at a distance in an ether rest frame could actually be extended to a frame that's moving in the ether and then we need to introduce this local time of Lorentz. Now, we have a triple intersection-- the path of map making and engineering, the path of philosophy-- this new philosophy of science-- and the path of physics. All three contained this idea that two events were simultaneous if two clocks were coordinated by the exchange of a signal. That was at the core of all three transformations of what was being used to determine longitude, of what was being used to define the philosophy of simultaneity, and what was being used to redefine time in this center-most area of physics-- the electricity and magnetism of things moving in the ether. \", 'chapter_mid': 'HarvardX/EMC2x/chapter/26cde64e24474f8aaf25332c0b6d25f1'}\n",

I think the terms of that are really misplaced. There are more than one way to be a modern. And Poincare was willing to challenge even very deep aspects of classical physics. He wanted to make simultaneity time and space connect to procedures that could really be done. In fact, procedures that he had done, the kind of detailed work about coordinating clocks to map the world. So Poincare was willing to accept Lorentz' s idea that objects contracted as they moved through the ether. And when he extended these ideas to telegraphers as they were coordinating clocks moving through the ether, well, even then he was willing to challenge the old idea of time and to say this notion of Lorentz's local time actually could be given a quite physical significance. Namely, that if you sent a light signal from one clock to another clock as they both moved through the ether, it would take longer for the light signal to travel as it beat against the apparent wind of the ether. So Poincare was willing in all sorts of ways to challenge established certainties. But is he Einsteinian? We'll talk about what Einstein stood for in the lectures to come. But Einstein famously denied the existence of the ether, and Poincare was never willing to do that. He knew perfectly well you couldn't have direct access to the ether's properties, but he thought it helped give us the intuitions that we needed to go on and build the physics that were necessary. It would be, I think, a little bit like saying to a carpenter, could you build a house without a hammer? And the carpenter might say, I could, but why would I do that? Poincare had that view about the ether. It was a useful notion that helped us advance our understanding. And it had proven itself time and time again in Maxwell's discovery of electric waves, in his own work that gave a physical meaning to the coordination of clocks, this idea of local time as the clocks moved through the ether. Poincare never gave up the distinction between true time, the time in the ether rest frame, and the apparent time everywhere else. So in certain ways, Poincare hovered in an intermediate zone, borrowing some aspects of the classical intuitions and concepts like a true time, like the ether. And other ways perfectly willing to challenge the older notions of physics, the idea that space and length was given once and for all where the time needn't be corrected for motion. These things were points that Poincare broke with in past physics. But this whole story that we've been engaged in, this notion in the late 19th century that time is connected to the most physical questions of engineering and trains, of mapping the world, this idea that it was attached to philosophy, this idea that it was attached to anarchism and the unification of political order, that it played a role in fiction, and so much else, is evocative in a way the pure analytic scholarship can't quite grasp in its entirety. And partly motivated by that, for years I've worked on a project with the great artist William Kentridge. And we produced an installation piece called The Refusal of Time. And as a way out of this discussion, of the blowing up of the meridian, the fearful reactions to that, the idea of establishing time in new and different contexts and relativity and eventually in black holes, we did this piece. And in shorthand way, on a single channel, not in the five channels that it was originally on in the installation, I want to show you a bit of what we did. So this is from Refusal of Time.

While the course has no prerequisites and you will be able to follow all the lectures even if you do not have a mathematical background, familiarity with these algebraic manipulations will greatly help your understanding and ease the solution of some of the numerical questions. We have posted an Algebra Primer with a review of basic power operations.\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\nCaution Note\\nWhen you submit numerical answers, insert only the number and not the unit. For example, if the answer you obtained is \\\\(1\\\\ s\\\\), you should only insert \"1\". The EdX platform can only evaluate numbers for the number input questions.\\nWhen submitting symbolic answers, you need to make sure you use the right symbols, otherwise the EdX platform will not be able to parse the expression and you will get a wrong answer or parse error. The only operation symbols you should use are: \"+\", \"-\", \"/\", \"*\", \")\", \"(\", \"^\". You will not need any other symbol for the questions in this course. For example, if you are answer for an expression is \\\\(a\\\\cdot b\\\\), \\\\(ab\\\\), \\\\(a\\\\ b\\\\), \\\\(a\\\\times b\\\\) then you should only insert \"a*b\".

While these lessons are not essential for following the video lectures, they will increase your understanding of the physics and they will give you a different perspective on equations and formulas. \\n\\nWhat makes an equation?\\n\\nIn school one often thinks about equations as formulas. The aim of a formula is to shorten or condense information into an expression so that you don't need to worry about the derivation. You want to know the volume of a sphere, you look for the right formula (\\\\(V=4\\\\pi r^3/3\\\\)), you plug in the value for the radius, you plug in the value for \\\\(\\\\pi\\\\), and you are done.  \\n\\nThe purpose of a formula is that you don't need to worry about it. Once you know what formula to use things are easy and you can worry about a different part of the problem. \\n\\nEquations (as we will look at them in this course) are different. Equations are something you want to contemplate and to understand how they were derived. Their fundamental role is not to shorten your computations, but to express a relation, to equate two physical quantities.  The easiest and most accessible way of contemplating an equation is to think about its dimensions.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnits and Dimensions\\n\\n You are all familiar with physical units. You know that a length can be measured in meters, miles, inches, kilometers etc; a time can be measured in seconds, hours, minutes etc; or a velocity can be measured in miles per hour, m/s, km/h etc. \\n Whenever a physical quantity is measured in units of length we will say that its dimension is a length, and we will denote that by \\\\(L\\\\); whenever a quantity is measured in units of time, we will say its dimension is time, and we will denote that by \\\\(T\\\\). \\n The dimension of velocity can be expressed in terms of the fundamental dimensions of Length and Time. We know that, by definition, a velocity is a length divided by time. We will express that by saying that the dimensions of velocity are \\\\(\\\\dfrac{L}{T}\\\\).  \\n\\nThe purpose of dimensions is to do away with the clutter of numbers and units. Often, it is easy to forget that mph (miles per hour) and m are two fundamentally different units because they refer to quantities which cannot be equated. A velocity will never be equal to a length; a volume cannot be equal to a length. The purpose of dimensions is to make sure we are never comparing apples with oranges. \\n\\n\\n The advantage of dimensions over units is that it really forces us to think about fundamental quantities. For example, is a light-year comparable to a meter, to a second or to a meter per second? To answer that question you must know that a light-year is a measure of distance. In this course we will say that a light-year has dimensions of distance.  \\nTo keep things, clear we will use square brackets to denote the dimensions of a physical quantity. For example, if the velocity of a car is \\\\(v = 10\\\\textrm{ miles/hour}\\\\), the dimensions of this quantity will be:\\n\\\\[[v]= \\\\dfrac{L}{T} = LT^{-1}\\\\]\\n Notice that the numerical values do not affect the dimensions of a quantity. \\n\\n The Fundamental Rule of Dimensional Analysis\\n\\\\[\\\\textrm{Dimensions on the left = Dimensions on the right}\\\\]\\n\\nAs we said, the purpose of dimensional analysis is to make sure we are always comparing apples with apples and oranges with oranges. Let\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s say you want to write down the distance \\\\(d\\\\) covered by some car that moves with constant velocity \\\\(v\\\\) in the time \\\\(\\\\Delta t\\\\). If you haven\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t taken a physics course in some time you might not remember the actual formula, and you could scramble different answers:\\n\\\\[ d \\\\stackrel{?}{=} v\\\\cdot \\\\Delta t\\\\]\\n\\\\[ d \\\\stackrel{?}{=} \\\\dfrac{v}{\\\\Delta t}\\\\]\\n\\\\[ d \\\\stackrel{?}{=} \\\\dfrac{\\\\Delta t}{v}\\\\]\\n\\nDimensional Analysis solves the problem for you! Let\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s compare the dimensions for each of these equations: \\n\\n\\\\[ [d] \\\\stackrel{?}{=} [v]\\\\cdot [\\\\Delta t]\\\\]\\n\\\\[ [d] \\\\stackrel{?}{=} \\\\dfrac{[v]}{[\\\\Delta t]}\\\\]\\n\\\\[ [d] \\\\stackrel{?}{=} \\\\dfrac{[\\\\Delta t]}{[v]}\\\\]\\nPlugging in the dimensions for these quantities we get: \\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n L &\\\\stackrel{?}{=} \\\\dfrac{L}{T}\\\\ T = L &\\\\checkmark \\\\\\\\\\n L &\\\\stackrel{?}{=} \\\\dfrac{L}{T}\\\\ \\\\dfrac{1}{T} = \\\\dfrac{L}{T^2} &\\\\times\\\\\\\\\\n L &\\\\stackrel{?}{=} T\\\\ \\\\dfrac{T}{L}=\\\\dfrac{T^2}{L} &\\\\times \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align*}\\nDimensional Analysis tells us which equation is a possible candidate, and which equations can never be true.  \", 'chapter_mid': 'HarvardX/EMC2x/chapter/26cde64e24474f8aaf25332c0b6d25f1'}\n",

It is quite cumbersome to write a small number as: [mathjaxinline] 0.000000000001 [/mathjaxinline]. How many zeros are there? You would have to count them all. Is this number smaller or greater than: [mathjaxinline] 0.0000000000001[/mathjaxinline]?\\nWe can instead use powers of [mathjaxinline] 10[/mathjaxinline] to express any number as a product of a digit term and an exponential term. For example, [mathjaxinline] 1890200 = 1.8902\\\\times 1000000 = 1.8902\\\\times 10^6[/mathjaxinline].\\nBecause [mathjaxinline] 0.1 = 10^{-1}[/mathjaxinline] we can also compress subunitary numbers: [mathjaxinline] 0.0000001 = 10^{-7}[/mathjaxinline]. This notation is not only more concise, but also much faster and error-proof in manipulations. For example:\\n[mathjaxinline] 1890200 \\\\times 0.0000001 = 1.8902\\\\times 10^6 \\\\times 10^{-7} = 1.8902\\\\times 10^{-1} [/mathjaxinline]', 'chapter_mid': 'HarvardX/EMC2x/chapter/26cde64e24474f8aaf25332c0b6d25f1'}\n",

Such occupations as the service of lighthouses and lightships come to mind.\" Solitude, Einstein argued, would be perfect for the young scientist engaged with philosophical and mathematical problems. His own youth, we are tempted to speculate, might be thought of this way. Reading the Bern Patent Office, where he had earned a living, as no more than such a distant oceanic lightship. Consistent with this picture of otherworldliness, we have enshrined Einstein as the philosopher scientist who, unmindful of the noise from his office work, re thought the foundations of his discipline and toppled the Newtonian absolutes of space and time. Einstein\\'s removal of these philosophical absolutes was more than a contribution to relativity. It has become a symbol of the overthrow of one philosophical epic for another. To physicists, like Henri Poincare and Hendrik Lorentz, Einstein\\'s special relativity was at first startling, almost incomprehensible because it began with basic assumptions about the behavior of clocks, rulers, and bodies in force-free motion. It began, in short, by assuming what these physicists had hoped to prove with their own very different starting assumptions about the structure of the electron, the nature of forces that connected them, and the dynamics of objects moving through the ether. As we will see in subsequent presentations, it wasn\\'t long before a new generation of physicists including Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr patterned its quantum epistemology around Einstein\\'s almost operational definitions of space and time in terms of measuring with rulers and coordinated clocks. For the philosophers of the Vienna Circle, those pioneers of a new philosophy of science, including Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, Einstein\\'s special relativity paper was also a turning point, an ever-present banner to be flown for a scientific philosophy that would put every concept to the test the way Einstein had with space and time. Einstein begins his thinking about relativity invoking Galileo. He is thinking, as so many physicists at the time were, that all the way back when Galileo was doing his physics, you had a principle of relativity. If you were constantly moving, Galileo imagined traveling in a sealed cabin on a sailing ship on a smooth Mediterranean Sea, the wind blowing at constant speed and nothing you could do in that cabin would reveal that you were in motion. You could have fish swimming a tank of water. You could have drops splash over. You could bounce a ball. Whatever you did would be indistinguishable from the way the same scene would take place where that cabin located on dry land. Now the problem was that when you came to questions of electricity and magnetism and the way they combined, for instance, to make electric waves, this didn\\'t seem to work. Why? Because Maxwell, back in the 19th century, had predicted that you could actually make electric waves that would travel along, and if they were nothing other than light, light was just these electric waves. Well, Maxwell thought, everyone thought that if you had a wave, it had to be a wave in something. Well, what was the medium in which these electric waves traveled? Well, it wasn\\'t air because we see the sun and that travels through empty space, so they said there must be something. Let\\'s call it the ether, which is everywhere and that ether supports the waves that are, in fact, light. So people wondered, is it really true that it wouldn\\'t matter if you were moving at constant speed through the ether. Well, it did seem like it should matter. It would be like racing through the desert on a flatcar with the wind in your face. What if you shot a light wave into the ether as you were racing across it, wouldn\\'t that be different than just being at rest in the ether and sending the wave along its way? Well, this bothered different people in different ways. Maybe you would need to make little correction when you were moving through the ether, but Einstein had a different picture. He wanted the principle of relativity that Galileo had enunciated to be true for all of physics and there was something that bothered him very specifically. In particular, suppose you have a coil and a magnet moving towards it. If we imagine the coil at rest in the ether, then the magnet moving towards it makes an electric field and you have one explanation from Maxwell about what\\'s going on. Maxwell says, when you move a magnet towards a coil, the magnetic field gets more intense near the coil and a change in magnetic field makes an electric field. An electric field drags the charges around, sends them to your home, and you can light up a light bulb. So that\\'s one explanation. But what if you take the magnet and fix it in the ether and move the coil towards it? Well now, you have a different explanation. The charges, as they move towards the magnet, experience a force because moving charges in a magnetic field experience a force according to Maxwell. So you have now a new explanation for why those charges are dragged around. Moving charges in a magnetic field get pulled around. There\\'s no electric field at all. Two explanations depending on which frame of reference you\\'re traveling with. Are you traveling with the magnet, or are you traveling with the coil? Einstein says two explanations, but only one phenomenon, one observable thing namely coil and magnet are approaching, and that bothered him. Einstein hated to have two different representations about what was going on if there was only one observable thing namely coil and magnet approach make current light up light bulb. From that very simple set of reasonings that seemed almost childish to his contemporaries, Einstein said, we need to have one, single explanation. We need a principle of relativity like Galileo\\'s that said it doesn\\'t matter which moving frame you\\'re in, the laws of physics are just as much the same from a magnet or a coil or a light as they would be for a fish swimming in a tub of water.

Because classical electrodynamics seemed to contravene such an extension. A classical physicist could argue against an extension of the principle of relativity like this:\\n\\nImagine that you are locked in a sealed chamber (no windows) and you want to decide if you are moving or not. Classical mechanics can only tell you if you are accelerating, but it cannot tell you anything if you are moving with constant velocity. You could very well be moving with constant velocity on very smooth tracks. However, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say you carry an optics experiment and you measure the speed of light. If you are moving fast enough and your experiment is sensitive enough maybe you can detect a difference between the value you measured in the sealed chamber and the value of the speed of light as you know it from the experiments that were carried at rest on Earth.\\n\\nClassical physicists could argue about this problem in two ways:\\n1. Light behaves like sound. If you are placed in a moving sealed chamber and you measure the speed of sound you will obtain the same value as if you were at rest because the air molecules move along with the chamber, so they are at rest relative to the chamber. If you are moving with supersonic speed no sounds can reach you from the outside, but inside all sounds behave as if you were at rest. Couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t light be like that? In this case the principle of relativity could be saved. However, Fizeau\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiment from 1851 showed that the aether was not (fully) dragged along by a moving object (the way air is moving along with the rotating Earth).\\n2. If light is not like sound and the aether is not dragged along by a moving object then the speed of light should depend on the velocity of a reference frame with respect to the aether. In this scenario you should be able to determine experimentally if your sealed chamber is moving or not. That is what Michelson and Morley hoped to achieve, but they failed. After their experiment, classical physicists would be forced to be opened to the idea of a generalized principle of relativity.\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end with a word from Poincare:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 all attempts to measure the velocity of the earth in relation to the ether have led to negative results. This time experimental physics has been more faithful to the principle [of relativity] than mathematical physics; the theorists, to put in accord their other general views, would not have spared it; but experiment has been stubborn in confirming it. \\nThus, the principle of relativity has been valiantly defended in these latter times, but the very energy of the defense proves how serious was the attack.
