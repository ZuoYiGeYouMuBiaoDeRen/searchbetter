Rewriter
========

The Rewriter module contains classes that help you rewrite single words and phrases
to a set of semantically related words and phrases. If you search for all of
these words and phrases on a search engine, you can get more, and more useful,
results than if you just searched for the original word or phrase.

For instance, `acceleration` could be rewritten to `acceleration, velocity, mass, force, physics`.

Visit the `interactive demo <https://github.com/hathix/searchbetter/blob/master/notebooks/searchbetter-demo.ipynb>`_
to learn how to use these classes.
