SearchBetter documentation home
========================================

`SearchBetter <https://github.com/hathix/searchbetter/>`_ lets you make powerful, fast, and drop-in search engines for any dataset, no matter how small or how large. It also offers built-in query rewriting, which uses NLP to help your search engines show users more, and more relevant, search results for any search term.

With query rewriting, your search engine can return results for additional topics that are semantically related to the user's original saerch. For instance, a search for `machine learning` would normally only return results for pages that contain the words "machine learning". But with query rewriting, you would get results not only for `machine learning` but also, say, `artificial intelligence` and `neural networks`.

SearchBetter lets you power up your search engines with minimal effort. It's especially useful if you have a small dataset to search on, or if you don't have the time or data to make complex custom query rewriting algorithms.
