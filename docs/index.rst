SearchBetter documentation home
========================================

`SearchBetter <https://github.com/hathix/searchbetter/>`_ lets you make powerful, fast, and drop-in search engines for any dataset, no matter how small or how large. It also offers built-in query rewriting, which uses NLP to help your search engines find semantically-related content to the user's search term.

For instance, a search for `machine learning` might only return results for items that contain the words "machine learning". But with query rewriting, you would get results not only for `machine learning` but also, say, `artificial intelligence` and `neural networks`.

SearchBetter lets you power up your search engines with minimal effort. It's especially useful if you have a small dataset to search on, or if you don't have the time or data to make fancy bespoke query rewriting algorithms.


Getting started
================
